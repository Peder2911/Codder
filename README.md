# Rigr

A structured data tidying pipeline with obligatory assumption-testing 
Inspired by Codd(1970) and Wickham(2014)

Currently implemented:
- :ledger: Column names must be specified for both input and output data
- :warning: Column types must be specified for both input and output data
- :key: The output data must have a column with a unique primary key value
