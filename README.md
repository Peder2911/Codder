# Rigr

A structured data tidying pipeline with obligatory assumption-testing 
Inspired by Codd(1970) and Wickham(2014)

Currently implemented:
- Column names must be specified for both input and output data
- Column types must be specified for both input and output data
- The output data must have a column with a unique value for each row
